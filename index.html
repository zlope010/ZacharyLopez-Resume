        My name is Zachary Lopez and I am a nineteen years old full-time student at University California Riverside. I am a first-year student and am majoring in Business Administration and intend to focus my degree in finance. Before attending college my professional background is that I interned at the accounting firm, MHT, for about four months. During this time I performed many tasks that could be applied to future jobs. Some of these tasks that I could apply at a new job would be how to work in an office setting, how to use Microsoft Excel to implement data, and how to file tax documents which are very important in many office settings as law, accounting, and other firms all file documents. Microsoft Excel is an important skill to have because at most professional jobs they are typically behind a computer or have to deal with a computer at some point in the job. Learning how to work in an office is also an important skill because a lot of people come into an office and do inappropriate things or stuff that is unacceptable in an office setting, but now I know how to behave perfectly. I have had other jobs as a high school student yet I do not feel they are appropriate to note for professional jobs, other than the fact that they are big franchise fast-food restaurants which are important in teaching how things are done in franchise companies in order same process to occur in different places and firms. As for my life as a student, I went to high school in Los Angeles at Cleveland high school and I learned many study habits that created who I am today. I have learned throughout my years that the best way to go about assignments is to not procrastinate. I have learned to always be on top of my tasks and get them done early so I can put in my best work. I think I have evolved as a student and no longer procrastinate my grades have been going uphill and am constantly improving. Another attribute that I have as a student is that I see myself as a perfectionist and being this way I think it can be good when applied to a professional job. This attribute is important in a professional job as I will always give my best work and check it when I can. My final attribute that I think I can bring to a professional job is a positive person as I feel like I am a positive person who can bring a good attitude to a workspace. Overall I think I have several qualities that are good for a professional job and am ready to begin my journey in the workforce.<br><br>
